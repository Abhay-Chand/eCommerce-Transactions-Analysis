# eCommerce Transactions Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of an eCommerce transactions dataset, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), lookalike modeling, and customer segmentation. The dataset comprises three files: `Customers.csv`, `Products.csv`, and `Transactions.csv`.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to gain insights into customer behavior, identify similar customers, and segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing patterns. The analysis was divided into three main tasks:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights:**
   - Conducted EDA to understand the data and identify key trends and patterns.
   - Extracted five business insights from the EDA.

2. **Lookalike Model:**
   - Built a model to identify similar customers based on their transaction history and customer profile.
   - Generated a list of the top 3 lookalikes for each customer.

3. **Customer Segmentation / Clustering:**
   - Segmented customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using the K-means clustering algorithm.
   - Identified the optimal number of clusters and analyzed the characteristics of each cluster.

## Files

*   `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the exploratory data analysis and business insights.
*   `Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the lookalike model development and results.
*   `Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the customer segmentation and clustering analysis.
*   `Lookalike.csv`: CSV file containing the top 3 lookalikes for each customer.
*   `Customers.csv`: CSV file containing customer data.
*   `Products.csv`: CSV file containing product data.
*   `Transactions.csv`: CSV file containing transaction data.

## Results

*   The EDA revealed key insights into customer behavior, product performance, and transaction patterns.
*   The lookalike model successfully identified similar customers based on their purchasing behavior.
*   The customer segmentation analysis identified three distinct customer clusters with unique characteristics.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the eCommerce transactions dataset. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to improve marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and optimize product offerings.

## Interactive Visualizations

The following interactive visualizations were created as part of this analysis:

### Customer Clusters

[Interactive scatter plot of customer clusters]

This scatter plot visualizes the customer clusters based on the first two principal components. You can hover over each point to see the customer ID, principal component values, and cluster assignment.

**Note:** To view the interactive visualizations, you need to run the Jupyter Notebooks in your local environment.
